# On calculating immanants on a quantum computer

Here will be the code for our ongoing project on calculating [immanants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanant) on a quantum computer. For now, there is only a program which prepares the immanant states (see Eq. 14 [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03528)), calculating the immanants themselves, and the variances. Later, we are going to also share the programs for variational preparation of such states.
