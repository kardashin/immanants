# On calculating immanants on a quantum computer

Here will be the code for our ongoing project on calculating [immanants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanant) on a quantum computer. For now, there is only a program for preparing the immanant states (see Eq. 14 [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03528)), computing their entropies, calculating the immanants themselves, and the variances. Later, we are going to also share the programs for variational preparation of such states.

Might be slightly outdated and contain some garbage.
